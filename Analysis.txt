A run time analysis (Worst Case Big-O Notation) of task solutions

Task 0:
Worst Case Big-O Notation is : O(1)
There are loops or inputs to go through.


Task 1:
Worst Case Big-O Notation is : O(n)
We accessed sequentially both files for two columns


Task 2:
Worst Case Big-O Notation is : O(n)
like task 1 here also we accessed all calls. Thats based on the no. of n(inputs)


Task 3:
Worst Case Big-O Notation is : O(n log n)
This happened because we need to do work of size 𝑂(𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝑛)) for every record (when there’s 𝑛 of them).


Task 4:
Worst Case Big-O Notation is : O(n log n)
An algorithm is said to have a quasilinear time complexity when each operation in the input data have a logarithm time complexity. 
It is commonly happens in sorting algorithms
